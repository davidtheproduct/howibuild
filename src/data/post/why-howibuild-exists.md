## Build Logs, Not Blog Posts

Traditional startup blogs are polished, sanitized, and written months after the fact. They miss the messy, real-time reality of building.

**howibuild.ai** is different. This is a build log—raw, unfiltered documentation of what it's actually like to build products as a solo founder.

## For the Technically Minded

This isn't for everyone. If you're looking for high-level strategy or motivational content, you won't find it here.

This is for:
- **Solo founders** wrestling with technical decisions
- **Product operators** managing multiple moving parts  
- **Builders** who want to see the real implementation details
- **Anyone** curious about the nitty-gritty of product development

## Radical Transparency

No sugar-coating. No post-hoc wisdom. Just real problems, real solutions, and real failures as they happen.

When I break my deployment with exposed API keys—you'll read about it. When I spend three hours debugging a database permission issue—that's a post. When an AI tool gives me bad advice—I'll call it out.

## The Anti-CMS Approach

Every post here lives as Markdown in a Git repository. No fancy content management system. No editorial calendar. No marketing funnel.

Just:
1. Write a `.md` file
2. Commit and push to GitHub
3. Netlify deploys automatically
4. Post is live

This workflow keeps the barrier to sharing low and the authenticity high.

## Guest Contributors Welcome

Built something interesting? Solved a gnarly technical problem? Have a founder war story worth sharing?

Send your Markdown file to hello@davidtheproduct.com or submit a pull request. 

The only requirement: it has to be real, technical, and useful to fellow builders.

## No Bullshit Zone

You won't find:
- Growth hacking listicles
- "10 Ways to Scale Your Startup" posts
- Motivational founder porn
- Content marketing disguised as advice

You will find:
- Actual code snippets and implementation details
- Database architecture decisions and their consequences  
- Tool evaluations based on real usage
- Time-stamped problem-solving in real-time

## Built With, For Builders

This site itself is a case study. Built with AstroWind, deployed on Netlify, tracked with PostHog. Dark mode by default because that's how we actually work.

Even the domain choice—`.ai`—isn't because this is an AI product. It's because artificial intelligence tools are now part of every builder's workflow, and we need to be honest about when they help and when they mislead.
