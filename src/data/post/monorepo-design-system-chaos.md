title: Monorepo Design System Chaos (Part 1)
excerpt: Three apps, one design system, and a $20 AI expert consultation. Here's what happens when Astro, Vite, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind collide in a monorepo, and why it's still not resolved.

## The Monorepo Dream

I've got three apps in my monorepo: a marketing site (Astro), an admin dashboard (React), and a core application (React). The dream? One design system that works across all of them.

Turborepo got me started quickly, but then reality hit. Hard...

## When Tech Stacks Collide

The problem wasn't the monorepo structure, it was the tech stack collision:

- **Astro** wants to be fast and static
- **Vite** wants to bundle everything efficiently  
- **shadcn/ui** expects React components
- **Tailwind** needs context to work properly

Each tool was designed for its own ecosystem. Making them play nice together? That's where things got messy.

## The Accessibility Wake-Up Call

The breaking point came with blue text on green buttons. Not just ugly, catastrophically inaccessible! WCAG AA requires 4.5:1 contrast ratio. These buttons were hitting 1.3:1 which was completely unacceptable.

## The $20 AI Expert Consultation

After days of minimal progress, I flew in [AmpCode](https://ampcode.com/) as an experiment as I'd heard good things. The idea is to use it as a "one-off expert", designed to solve the toughest of problems. Access to "Oracle mode" and $10 free credit to get started seemed worth it to break the back of this.

**Reality check**: AmpCode was...okay. Not bad, but not the saving grace I'd hoped for. It identified the core issue: my design system had grown into 8+ packages with complex interdependencies. Each app was importing different combinations, leading to configuration drift and build failures.

But here's the catchâ€”it burned through credits fast, and wasn't able to wrangle the mess I'd made. After hitting 200k tokens, costs skyrocketed. The "Oracle mode" is powerful, but it's expensive when you're deep in complex debugging sessions.

## The Simplification That Actually Worked

The Oracle's prescription? Nuclear simplification.

**Before**: 8+ packages (`@sbp/theme`, `@sbp/tailwind-preset`, `@sbp/ui`, etc.)
**After**: 1 package (`@sbp/ui`) with everything inside

```css
/* One import gets you everything */
@import '@sbp/ui/tokens.css';

/* Design tokens that actually work */
:root {
  --primary: #047857; /* WCAG AA compliant */
  --accent: #0369a1;  /* WCAG AA compliant */
}
```

The key insight: Pure CSS classes should work everywhere. Tailwind's `@apply` directives? They break in production builds when the context isn't available.

## The Cross-Framework Solution

Instead of fighting the frameworks, we worked with them:

**React apps**:
```tsx
import { Button } from '@sbp/ui';
<Button variant="default">Works everywhere</Button>
```

**Astro app**:
```astro
<button class="btn btn-default">Same visual result</button>
```

Same CSS classes, same design tokens, same accessibility standards.

## What Actually Broke (And Why)

### Build System Context Dependencies
Tailwind's `@apply` directives failed during production builds. The CSS classes worked in development but failed in CI/CD because Tailwind context wasn't available in all build environments.

### Package Interdependency Hell
Multiple packages created lockfile sync issues and configuration drift, which is one of the gothas and downsides of a monorepo. The marketing app was missing `@sbp/ui` entirely, using deep relative path imports instead ðŸ¤¦

## Small Wins From Today

While the design system isn't fully resolved, we made some progress:

### Package Consolidation âœ…
- Reduced from 8+ packages to 1 unified `@sbp/ui` package
- Eliminated configuration drift between apps
- Simplified import paths across the monorepo

### Documentation Cleanup âœ…
- Consolidated scattered docs into clear structure
- Created comprehensive developer onboarding guide
- Added deployment workflow to prevent lockfile issues
- Moved completed docs to archive system

### Accessibility Improvements âœ…
- Primary color contrast: 3.3:1 â†’ 4.6:1 
- Accent color contrast: 2.6:1 â†’ 4.5:1  
- Fixed the catastrophic blue-on-green button issue

## The Real Lesson

The tools aren't the problem. The architecture is.

When you're building a design system for multiple frameworks, choose solutions that work in the lowest common denominator environment. Pure CSS beats framework-specific tailoring every time.

## What I'd Do Differently

1. **Start simple**: One package, not eight
2. **Use semantic CSS classes**: Easier to debug than utility combinations
3. **Frequently ask why**: At each step of the process ask the LLM why we are doing X? Do we have research that proves this is best practice? Is there a simpler way? Are we over engineering things?

## The Stack That Survived

- **Monorepo**: Turborepo (still solid)
- **Design System**: Single `@sbp/ui` package
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with design tokens
- **Components**: shadcn/ui for React, semantic classes for Astro
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliant by design

## What's Next?

I'm contemplating two paths forward:

1. **Claude Flow Hive Mind**: Try a different AI approach with multiple agents working in parallel
2. **Call it good enough**: Pivot back to UX improvements and get the monorepo to match the old repo's core app user experience

I'll decide in the morning when I'm not so tired. Stay tuned for Part 2.

## Your Turn

Building a cross-framework design system? Start with one package. Use pure CSS. Test accessibility early and often.

The complexity will find you soon enough. Don't invite it in from the beginning.

**Pro tip**: If you're considering AmpCode for complex debugging, budget for the token costs. The Oracle mode is powerful but expensive when you're deep in the weeds.
