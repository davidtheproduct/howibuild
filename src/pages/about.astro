        The Reality of Building
      </h3>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        Most startup content is sanitized, post-hoc wisdom written months after the fact. 
        I document the actual process—the database dramas, deployment failures, and technical decisions 
        that happen in real-time.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300">
        Whether it's merging three repositories into a monorepo (and breaking everything), 
        wrestling with database permissions, or questioning whether AI tools are helping or hindering—
        you'll get the unfiltered truth here.

        Why This Exists
      </h3>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The startup ecosystem is full of polished success stories and post-hoc wisdom. 
        What's missing is honest documentation of the building process—the failed attempts, 
        the technical debt, the 3am database migrations.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300">
        This site exists for fellow builders who want to see what it actually looks like 
        to build products as a solo founder. No sugar-coating, no motivational fluff—just 
        the real work.
