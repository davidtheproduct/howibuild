        The Reality of Building
      </h3>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        A lot of startup content is polished, wisdom written months after the fact. 
        I document the actual process—the database dramas, deployment failures, and technical decisions 
        that happen in real-time.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300">
        Whether it's merging three repositories into a monorepo (and breaking everything), 
        wrestling with database permissions, or questioning whether AI tools are helping or hindering—
        you'll get a front row seat to vibe coding in action.

        Why This Exists
      </h3>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        I've learned a bucket load building my first startup in the last few months.
        This is for fellow builders who are looking for advice or want to compare notes with others.
        Over time, my hope is that this becomes a community of like minded builders who give back and lift eachother up :)
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300">
        This is not a backlog of things we might get to one day. Let's be honest, we all have one of those.
        This is a build log, a live account of what is happening in the moment, when it matters.
