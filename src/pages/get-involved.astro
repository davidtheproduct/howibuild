        What Makes a Great Build Log?
      </h3>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
        The best posts are specific, technical, and honest. They show the actual work—the debugging sessions, 
        the architecture debates, the "oh shit" moments when you realize you've been doing it wrong.
      </p>
      
      <p class="text-muted dark:text-gray-300">
        Don't worry about perfect writing. Worry about sharing something real that will help another builder 
        avoid your mistakes or learn from your wins. That's what this community is about.
