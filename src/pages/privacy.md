## We Take Your Privacy Seriously

At HowIBuild, we believe in transparency and respect for your privacy. This policy explains how we handle your information when you visit our website or subscribe to our newsletter.

**The short version**: We collect minimal data, don't sell anything, and you can unsubscribe anytime.

## What Information We Collect

We collect only what's necessary to provide our service:

- **Email address** (if you subscribe to our newsletter)
- **Basic website analytics** (like page views) to understand how our content performs
- **No personal tracking** - we don't follow you around the internet

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information only for legitimate purposes:

- **Newsletter**: To send you build logs and updates (only if you subscribe)
- **Website improvement**: To understand which content is most helpful
- **Communication**: To respond to your questions or feedback

We never sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.

**Future paid services**: If we ever create paid services, we'll clearly tell you in advance and you can choose whether to opt in. You're always in control of your data and participation.

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your information:

- **Unsubscribe anytime**: Every email includes an unsubscribe link
- **Access your data**: Email us to see what information we have about you
- **Delete your data**: We'll remove your information upon request
- **No tracking**: We don't use cookies or tracking pixels for advertising

## Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but no system is 100% secure. We use industry-standard practices to keep your data safe.

## Third-Party Services

We use trusted services to run our website and send newsletters. We only share the minimum information necessary:

- **PostHog** - Analytics service to understand how our content performs ([Privacy Policy](https://posthog.com/privacy))
- **Beehiiv** - Email platform for our newsletter ([Privacy Policy](https://beehiiv.com/privacy))

These services have their own privacy policies and data practices. We chose them because they respect user privacy and provide clear data controls.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy occasionally. We'll notify you of significant changes via email or a notice on our website.
